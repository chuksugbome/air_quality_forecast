Machine learning model for predicting air quality levels using environmental data.

The use of models, such as the Random Forest regressor developed here in predicting AIr Quality from low-cost sensor data, are crucial for several reasons, particularly in an era of increasing urbanization, climate variability, and public health concerns.
* Enhancing Public Health Protection
PM2.5, or fine particulate matter, is a serious air pollutant connected to health problems like respiratory and heart diseases, as well as early deaths. Accurate prediction models help people and communities check their exposure in real time and take steps to protect themselves, like staying indoors when pollution is high. Using machine learning to improve data from low-cost sensors, these models give more reliable estimates of personal exposure, especially indoors where most people spend their time.
* Informing Policy and Urban Planning
These models help governments spot areas where pollution might get worse because of things like temperature or humidity. This information supports decisions about controlling emissions, managing traffic, and planning green spaces. For example, the models can check if indoor air quality in offices or homes meets standards, all without needing expensive equipment.
* Advancing Research and Climate Adaptation
These models show how weather patterns affect pollution, which helps researchers study the effects of climate change. In places with fewer resources, sensors improved by machine learning offer a practical way to keep researching and turn raw data into useful information for sustainable growth.
In summary, this model shows how affordable technology can change the way we manage air quality. It helps create healthier environments and makes data more available to everyone, especially as we look ahead to late 2025.
